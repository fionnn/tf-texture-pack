Shawty's like a melody in my head

That I can't keep out

Got me singin' like

Na na na na everyday

It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head

That I can't keep out

Got me singin' like

Na na na na everyday

It's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)

Hey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober

I got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover

On my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga

So down on the line make me want a cold soda

Hey baby be my radio

Hear you everywhere I go

Music in my head

Know your melody in every note

Girl you incredible

Make yourself available

Na na na na

That tune so exceptional

Sexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready

We can make plans get body stand if you let me

Girl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me

I ain't a fight she gon arrest me

Shawty's like a melody in my head

That I can't keep out

Got me singin' like

It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

See you been all around the globe

Not once did you leave my mind

We talk on the phone, from night til the morn

Girl you really change my life

Doin things I never do

I'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes

We're real worldwide, breakin all the rules

Someday I wanna make you my wife

That girl, like somethin off a poster

That girl, is a dime they say

That girl, is the gun to my holster

She's runnin through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head

It's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

The one that could fill your fantasies

So come baby girl let's sing with me
